Stimulating a Garage business with stacks

- If a customer arrives to pick up a car that is not nearest the exit, all cars blocking the cars' path are moved into the other lane. If more cars still must be moved out of the way, they go into the street. When the customer's car is driven out, all cars in the street must be put back into the garage.
- Cars are assumed to arrive and depart in the order specified by the input. The program should print a message whenever a car arrives or departs.
- When a car arrives, the message should specify whether or not there is room in the garage for the car. If there is no room, the car leaves without entering. When a car departs, the message should include the number of times the car had to be moved out of the way so that other cars could depart. Each move from one lane to the other counts as 1; each move to the street counts as 1; each move from the street to a lane counts as 1. Don't forget to check for conditions such as someone wanting a car that's not in the garage, trying to park a car but both lanes are full, trying to park a car when only one lane is full, etc
